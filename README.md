# fyp-experimentation
The experiement part of my FYP. 

## Introduction
This involves the source codes and files that I used for my FYP experimentation phase. <br> 
Three symmetric encryption algos were experimented: LEA, TWOFISH and XTEA.
<br> Each key lengths of these encryption algos are tested by recording their wall time & CPU time of encrypting/decrypting several documents.
<br> Thus, the results ("TIME TRIALS yada yada" files) are....a lot. Consists of LEA-128, LEA-192, LEA-256, TWOFISH-128, TWOFISH-192, TWOFISH-256, and XTEA-128.
<br> Initially wnated to test TWINE but it is not provided in the library used and I never learnt about partitioning technique (I am completely new to cryptography). 
<br> We do not have ample time for FYP. Soooo yeet <br>
<br>
<b> The file is a bit of a mess..Maybe I will tidy it up later ehee </b>

## Info on my FYP
<br>
<b> Title </b> : Securing Documents using Web-based Encryption Tool<br>
<b> Scope </b> : Symmetric Cryptography <br>
<b> Target Scope </b> : Lecturers/ Researchers<br>
<b> Main motivation/objective </b> : <br> Provide a platform that allows lecturers to share documents through a private and secure way. 
<br> Think of it like Google Drive but with extra layers, where you can't open the file if you are not among the selected participants and
if you do not have the key<br>
<br><br>
## Others
<b> Library used: </b> CryptoPP Library 
<br> The functions are referenced from their wiki page.
