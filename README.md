## Info on my FYP
<br>
<b> Title </b> : Securing Documents using Web-based Encryption Tool<br>
<b> Scope </b> : Symmetric Cryptography <br>
<b> Target Scope </b> : Lecturers/ Researchers<br>
<b> Main motivation/objective </b> : <br> Provide a platform that allows lecturers to share documents through a private and secure way.

if you do not have the key<br>
